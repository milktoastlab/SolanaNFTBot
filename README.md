## Running using docker

### Requirement
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) >= v20.10
  * If you're new to Docker, we recommend going through their [get started page](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) to gain a basic understanding of Docker before moving forward.
* A Solana RPC node/server - This is needed so the bot know where to call to fetch solana transactions.
Here are some potential routes to get a node:
  * https://quicknode.com/
  * [Run your own](https://medium.com/@MisterKevin_js/how-to-run-your-own-solana-rpc-endpoint-on-figments-datahub-e9ca881bebb7)



### Instructions

#### Run bot locally using docker in the terminal

If you're new to docker, before starting I recommend 

Run the following command with your own secrets replaced with your own configuration:

```
docker run --name nftbot -d -p 4000:4000 -e SOLANA_RPC=YOURRPCURL -e DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=YOURDISCORDTOKEN -e SUBSCRIPTION_DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=YOURCHANNELID -e SUBSCRIPTION_MINT_ADDRESS=YOURMINTADDRESS milktoastlab/solananftbot
```
Note: The command above is tested in linux/unix env only. You may have a different experience in Windows.
Please check the [documentation on how to run docker command in windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick-start/run-your-first-container) if you need any help.

View logs
```
docker logs ntfbot
```

To make sure the bot is working properly, use [/test-sale-tx](src/server.ts#L47) endpoint. Remove Tweet=true off of the end if you do not want to test twitter functionality
```
curl "http://localhost:4000/test-sale-tx?signature={sale_transaction_signature}&channelId={discord_channel_id}&tweet=true"
```

In case of *DiscordAPIError: Missing Access* error, check if the bot has been invited to the channel. Go to the channel, click "Add members or roles" and add your bot account as a member.


Alternatively, you can run it using docker-compose:

Update `.env` with your secret and run
```
docker-compose up -d bot
```

See [here](#configurable-environments) for more details on environment variables

```
docker-compose logs bot
```

## Running in development
### Requirement
* Node >= 16.6
* Yarn

### Instructions

#### 1. Install dependencies
```
yarn install
```

#### 2. Update .env with your secrets

Follow the instructions [here](#configurable-environments)

#### 3. Run the server
```

```

## Configurable environments

Here are a list of environments you need to configure before running the NFT bot.

```sh
# RPC node url
SOLANA_RPC=
# Discord bot secret
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=
# The discord channel to notify
SUBSCRIPTION_DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=
# Mint address to watch for sales
SUBSCRIPTION_MINT_ADDRESS=
# Twitter secrets
TWITTER_API_KEY=
TWITTER_API_KEY_SECRET=
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=
# Magic eden API
MAGIC_EDEN_URL=https://api-mainnet.magiceden.dev/v2
# Enter the NFT collection that you want to track
MAGIC_EDEN_COLLECTION=
# The discord channel to notify
MAGIC_EDEN_DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=
```
https://github.com/milktoastlab/SolanaNFTBot/blob/main/.env

### Variable breakdowns

#### DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
This is your discord bot secret.
If you don't have a discord bot yet, you can create one following the instructions here:
https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html

Make sure your bot has the required permissions:
* View channels
* Read/Send messages
* Send messages
* Embed links

#### SUBSCRIPTION_DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID
This is the ID of the discord channel you want to send notifications to.
You will need to enable developer mode have access the channel IDs.
Here are the instructions:
https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-

#### SUBSCRIPTION_MINT_ADDRESS
This is the address that you want the Solana NFT bot to watch for notifications.
It needs to be one of the creator addresses:
<img width="324" alt="Screen Shot 2021-11-12 at 6 16 31 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90617759/141426468-fcf7c522-4480-4a4e-b1e9-c0cbed3f4f10.png">

_Note: Avoid personal addresses because it could detect unwanted sales._

##### Watch multiple addresses
You can watch multiple addresses at once by using a comma between addresses:
```bash
SUBSCRIPTION_MINT_ADDRESS=add123,add1235
```
This feature reduces the need to run multiple containers in production.

#### Twitter variables

__Experimental:__
We haven't stress test Twitter notification on high volume projects. We recommend you have a good internet connection for your bot if you want to use this feature, because for each notification, the bot will upload the nft image to Twitter for display. 
Create a Github issue to let us know if you encounter any problems.


To post sales notification tweets to Twitter via the API, you will first need Elevated access to the Twitter API.

While logged in to the account you want to use the Twitter API for, apply for Elevated access to the twitter API by clicking the link here and following the steps: 
https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info

The approval process may take a while. 

Create a new project, and create a new App under that project.

The API Key and secret will be displayed to you there, which you'll assign to `TWITTER_API_KEY` and `TWITTER_API_KEY_SECRET` respectively.

Then, click on the Keys and tokens tab, and generate the Access Token and Secret. Assign these to `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` respectively.

### Magic Eden variables
Magic eden's NFT trading program has changed to V2, which means the old way of detecting sales won't work anymore. We have updated the bot to use the new API to detect sales.  
To enable this feature, you will need to add the following variables to your `.env` file:

__MAGIC_EDEN_COLLECTION__ 

This is the collection key to magic eden. To find our what it is, navigate to the collection page and look at the url. It should be the last part of the url.
```
Example:
https://magiceden.io/marketplace/milktoast
```
The collection key is "milktoast"

__MAGIC_EDEN_DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID__

This is the discord channel to notify. Same as `SUBSCRIPTION_DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID` but it doesn't support multiple channels at the moment.
